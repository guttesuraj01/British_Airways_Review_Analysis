       " ' Trip Verified  Terrible Experience with British Airways I booked a flight with BA to travel from Gibraltar to London Heathrow on May 10 2023 My flight was scheduled to leave at 400 pm in the afternoon I had originally planned on leaving my luggage at Heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousins place En route to GIB airport a few hours prior to departure I checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled I had a connecting flight booked with Westjet from London Heathrow to Vancouver the following day and I had to make that flight so it was imperative that I got to London I checked the BA website and couldnt find any other flights with them that would work so unfortunately I made the mistake of requesting a refund I managed to find a flight out of Malaga that got me into London just after 1000 pm so I booked that and then called British Airways as I wanted to discuss compensation Thats when they advised me that because I had requested a refund they used the phrase abandoned travel with them they were not prepared to do anything for me Apparently I should have called them first and then they would have made the arrangements Of course they dont explain that on their website  they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed And even when I plead my case with the agent at Malaga airport and then followed up with Customer Relations several times via email they flat out refused to budge I had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used Avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip Once this incident happened I ended up spending 660 euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to London from Malaga ie different airport than the one I had originally booked from And because the luggage storage facility at Heathrow had closed by the time I eventually arrived I ended up booking a night at a hotel since I couldnt travel by train to my cousins place any longer 3 bags in tow and I didnt want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up This cost me another 125 in room and meal costs All BA ended up doing to compensate me was to give me 5000 free Avios  a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses Despite trying to explain to them why I requested the refund instead of calling them first they wouldnt budge Very easy for them to say what I should have done since they work there and know the rules and they werent the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours I pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens and that way they would never encounter this problem My feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake I did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money Ive been an Executive Club member for years and they simply didnt care They said there was nothing they could do Im sure if one of the BA executives friends or family members had gone through this staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right I used to be a fan of BA but they have really gone downhill in my opinion Once I used up my remaining Avios and travel credit I will cancel my Executive Club membership and never fly with them again',\n",

       " ' Trip Verified  A simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyone My partner and I recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from London City Airport to Frankfurt When we purchased the tickets I mistakenly entered my name twice eg Mr John Smith and Ms John Smith Little did we know that our 1 simple mistake would cost us over 300 pounds Upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name apparently they can only change 3 letters where there has been a typo and I had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if I wanted to board the flight  the price almost seven times  higher than my original ticket Zero empathy was shown Zero alternative was offered Trusting BAs staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket Immediately after I purchased the ticket I contacted BAs Commercial Change Booking Team and informed them of our situation The service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee He offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then advising me that I had a claim to the difference and I should contact Customer Support to do so I told this person several times I wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer I would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket He said no I could claim the difference Fair enough  we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with Customer Support for the difference Two days later British Airways Customer Response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight Theyve continued to send generic emails until this week when they just stopped responding So in short British Airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund It keeps me up at night thinking how they can do this and get away with it so easily',\n",
